this folder contains a very simple example of using softlandia / glasio to manipulate a LAS file

__function test1 ()__ reads the file "expand_points_01.las"
saves messages created upon opening to the file "expand_points_01.warning.las"
saves the repaired file "expand_points_01 + .las"

__function test2 ()__ creates a las object with one curve in memory, writes this object to the file "simple.las"
